Image Resize filter for Drupal 8
-------------------------------------------

Resizes images based on width and height attributes and optionally link to the
original image.

_NOTE_



The original plan is to provide two filters: one to create an image derivative
and the other to link the derivative to the source (original) image. For now,
only the latter has been implemented.
